# DTAGCN
The repo is the official implementation for the paper: **Dual-token Aware Graph Convolution Network with Interpretability for Long-term Multi-station
Irrigation Water Level Forecasting**. It currently includes code implementations for the following tasks:

**Multivariate Forecasting**: We provide the script and dataset to reproduce forecasting results in this repo.

# Usage
Install Pytorch and other necessary dependencies.

pip install -r requirements.txt

Train and evaluate the model. We provide all the above tasks under the folder ./scripts/. You can reproduce the results as the following examples:

bash ./scripts/water/DTAGCN.sh
